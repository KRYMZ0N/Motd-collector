# Motd collector
This is a project I am working on to collect motd's made by players from discord in the format (motd: &lt;message>) and convert them into usable motd's for a minecraft server.

## About
This project is coded in python, and I happen to suck at python, feel free to give me tips! :D </br> But... I am using this project to try to get a better understanding on how python works, so don't expect me to be able to fix things with ease. If you want to fork this project and make your own thing with it, feel free!

## The future!
In the future I plan on adding a feature to format these more and allows you to configure them to work with many multi motd server plugins! I also plan on adding a feature to ignore Player usernames and non motd: messages since if you use this, you will notice It also collects player names and other messages. I apologize about the inconveniences of this script, I am a noob at python, but I will be working on fixing them!

## How-to
To use this script, highlight all the motds in your discord chat and copy and paste them into the Input.txt file. Then download python3 and open up cmd or terminal if you are on another OS, and  cd into the scripts directory. Just run python3 Grabber.py and then you are all set! Enjoy!
